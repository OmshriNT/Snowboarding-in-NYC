      Casey Neistat, an awesome YouTuber and filmmaker took the internet by
      storm. On Jan 23, 2016, Casey decides to go on snowboarding pulled by a
      custom-built car which was specially designed to run on the snow-covered
      roads.

      The dangerous stunt Casey pulled that day was certainly illegal. The NYPD
      police cars couldn't keep up with the Jeep, because of the weather
      condition. This became a preferable condition for people who are looking
      for an adventurous day. Going up and down must have felt really good.

      For the climax, Casey uplifted the American flag in the New York Times
      Square. The people even cheered for him as he swift away. Watch the whole
