          Casey Neistat, an awesome YouTuber and filmmaker took the internet by
          storm. On Jan 23, 2016, Casey decides to go on snowboarding pulled by
          a custom-built car which was specially designed to run on the
          snow-covered roads. The dangerous stunt Casey pulled that day was
          certainly illegal.

          The NYPD police cars couldn't keep up with the Jeep, because of the
          weather condition. This became a preferable condition for people who
          are looking for an adventurous day. Going up and down must have felt
          really good. For the climax, Casey uplifted the American flag in the
          New York Times Square. The people even cheered for him as he swift
          away.
